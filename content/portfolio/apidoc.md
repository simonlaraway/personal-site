**Description:** This is content I wrote to document Guidewire's [Billing API](https://docs.guidewire.com/cloud/bc/latest/cloudapibf/cloudAPI/topics/landing_Cloud-API-consumer.html). This chapter describes how producers (otherwise known as insurance agents or brokers) can make and manage payments to BillingCenter through the API. 

**Tools:** Postman, Oxygen, Github
