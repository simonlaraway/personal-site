**Description:** This is an overview of SEO and a tutorial on implementing it in a specific web publishing context. I wrote for a non-technical audience of writers at BYU's Humanities Digital Media and Communications office.

It provides an brief explanation of what SEO is and how writers should consider it and implement it when writing content. It then gives detailed information on how to apply SEO settings on the content management system that writers use to publish web articles.

**Tools used:** *Microsoft Word, Adobe Illustrator*
