This brief topic details a previously undocumented behavior of an API in Guidewire's CloudAPI platform.

It provides information on using a PATCH HTTP request and how this necessitates different fields in the body of the request than other HTTP requests, which are documented in other topics which I provided links to.

I wrote this topic with the supervision of a senior tech writer after discovering this previously undocumented behavior in my own test calls (using Postman).

I present it here as a PDF downloaded from the official Guidewire docs site. It was authored in Oxygen XML editor and published in HTML, and then I generated the PDF from that HTML. Hopefully that explains any odd formatting.

**Tools used:** *Oxygen XML Editor, Postman*
