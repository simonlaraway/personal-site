        <div>
            <p>I've been interested in reading and writing most of my life. I selected a college major I hoped would guide me to a career writing and editing. At some point in my college career, I realized that I 
                preferred writing and editing in a style that was economical, precise, and useful.   </p>
                <p>This realization coincided with a burgeoning interest in programming and web development. Thanks to some classes in the Editing and Publishing program, I discovered technical writing. I enjoyed the process of gaining knowledge of technical subjects and communicating them in language as clear and concise as possible. And the rest is history.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I'm soccer fan and (very amateurish) player. In my free time, I like lifting weights and running. I read, too.</p>
