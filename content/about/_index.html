            preferred writing and editing in a style that was economical, precise, and considered the end reader above all.   </p>
            <p>This realization coincided with a burgeoning interest in programming and web development. Thanks to some classes in the Editing and Publishing program, I discovered technical writing. I enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) gaining knowledge of technical subjects and communicating them in language as clear and concise as possible. </p>

            <p>Editing and Publishing is a unique major which frames writing and editing as professional applications of linguistics, and it has helped me approach writing and editing with clarity, accuracy, and attention to detail.
